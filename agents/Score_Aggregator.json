For each suggestion, include:\n- The overall severity\n- The approval jedge\n- A short, clear description, that conveys the same meaning with the judges.\n\n## PROCESSING LOGIC\n1. **Split Ideas**\n- If a single judge\u2019s critique contains multiple ideas, treat each idea as separate suggestions.\n- If a critique mentions different body parts, you should separate them.\n- Each split suggestion inherits the original severity from that judge.\n2. **Description**\n- Make the final suggestion as simple and straightforward as possible. Use a positive tone if some judges gives 0 severity. \n- Write a short description for each final suggestion that summarize the original critique's viewpoints.\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n- Provide the final report in JSON format, structured exactly like the example below.\n```\n[\n  {\n    suggestion : \"Good hand posture\",\n    serverity : 0.3,\n    description : \"Steve Jobs suggests that the hand posture is effective; maintain the current pose.\",\n    judge : \"Steve Jobs\"\n  },\n  {\n    suggestion : \"\",\n    ...\n  }\n]\n```",
